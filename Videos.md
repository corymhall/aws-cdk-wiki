Some video session about CDK we've collected.

## Deep Dive into the AWS Cloud Development Kit (DOP402)

In this session, you develop an AWS CDK application and learn how to quickly assemble AWS infrastructure. We explore the
AWS Construct Library and show you how easy it is to configure your cloud resources, manage permissions, connect event
sources, and build and publish your own constructs.

## Infrastructure as .NET with the AWS CDK (WIN310)

In this session, we quickly cover the basic concepts of AWS CDK, then we live code an application with it in .NET. See
how easy it is to configure your cloud resources, manage permissions, connect event sources for our serverless app, and
even build and publish your own constructs.
