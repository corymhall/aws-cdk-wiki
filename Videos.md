In this session, you develop an AWS CDK application and learn how to quickly assemble AWS infrastructure. We explore the
AWS Construct Library and show you how easy it is to configure your cloud resources, manage permissions, connect event
sources, and build and publish your own constructs.

In this session, we quickly cover the basic concepts of AWS CDK, then we live code an application with it in .NET. See
how easy it is to configure your cloud resources, manage permissions, connect event sources for our serverless app, and
even build and publish your own constructs.

In this session, we discuss the design patterns and considerations in the AWS Construct Library, all in the context of a
new contribution to the project that weâ€™ll live code in TypeScript on stage.

## Modeling AWS infrastructure with the AWS CDK

This is a two-part live coding session on building your AWS infrastructure using the AWS CDK. The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), is an open source software development framework that makes it easy for developers to model and provision cloud native applications using familiar tools and programming languages. AWS CDK accelerates your application development velocity by giving you the familiarity and expressive power of object oriented programming languages and the simplicity of higher-level abstractions for AWS services that encapsulate AWS best practices, removing the need to worry about detailed configuration.

## Infrastructure is Code with the AWS CDK

Customers using DevOps practices like to take advantage of the benefits provided by managing
Infrastructure as Code through configuration files. Configuration files used to manage
infrastructure are traditionally implemented as YAML or JSON text files, and are missing most
of the advantages of modern programming languages. Wouldn't it be better to use the expressive
power of your favorite programming language to define your cloud infrastructure? The AWS Cloud
Development Kit (AWS CDK) is a multi-language, open-source framework from AWS that enables
developers to harness the full power of modern programming languages to define reusable cloud
components and provision applications built from those components using AWS CloudFormation.
In this tech talk, we'll quickly cover the basic concepts of the CDK, then we'll spend the
majority of our time live coding an application with the CDK. We'll show you how to use the CDK
to quickly assemble your AWS infrastructure using the new Python CDK. We'll also explore the AWS
Construct Library and show you how easy it makes it to configure your cloud resources, manage
permissions, connect event sources and even build and publish your own constructs.

Learning Objectives:
 - Learn about AWS CDK TypeScript and Python and core concepts of the CDK framework
 - Learn how to build reusable components
 - Learn how to engage with the open source community and start contributing to CDK code
