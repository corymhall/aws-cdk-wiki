In this session, you develop an AWS CDK application and learn how to quickly assemble AWS infrastructure. We explore the
AWS Construct Library and show you how easy it is to configure your cloud resources, manage permissions, connect event
sources, and build and publish your own constructs.

This is a two-part live coding session on building your AWS infrastructure using the AWS CDK. The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), is an open source software development framework that makes it easy for developers to model and provision cloud native applications using familiar tools and programming languages. AWS CDK accelerates your application development velocity by giving you the familiarity and expressive power of object oriented programming languages and the simplicity of higher-level abstractions for AWS services that encapsulate AWS best practices, removing the need to worry about detailed configuration.
