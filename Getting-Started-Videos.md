Customers using DevOps practices like to take advantage of the benefits provided by managing
Infrastructure as Code through configuration files. Configuration files used to manage
infrastructure are traditionally implemented as YAML or JSON text files, and are missing most
of the advantages of modern programming languages. Wouldn't it be better to use the expressive
power of your favorite programming language to define your cloud infrastructure? The AWS Cloud
Development Kit (AWS CDK) is a multi-language, open-source framework from AWS that enables
developers to harness the full power of modern programming languages to define reusable cloud
components and provision applications built from those components using AWS CloudFormation.
In this tech talk, we'll quickly cover the basic concepts of the CDK, then we'll spend the
majority of our time live coding an application with the CDK. We'll show you how to use the CDK
to quickly assemble your AWS infrastructure using the new Python CDK. We'll also explore the AWS
Construct Library and show you how easy it makes it to configure your cloud resources, manage
permissions, connect event sources and even build and publish your own constructs.

Learning Objectives:
 - Learn about AWS CDK TypeScript and Python and core concepts of the CDK framework
 - Learn how to build reusable components
 - Learn how to engage with the open source community and start contributing to CDK code

In this session, we quickly cover the basic concepts of AWS CDK, then we live code an application with it in .NET. See
how easy it is to configure your cloud resources, manage permissions, connect event sources for our serverless app, and
even build and publish your own constructs.
