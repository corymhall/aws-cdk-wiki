For 10 years, the global cloud community has come together at AWS re:Invent to meet, get inspired, and rethink what's possible. This year we are getting back together for biggest, most comprehensive, and most vibrant event in cloud computing.
CDK is going to be presented in 44(!) sessions. Not only in Developer Productivity & DevOps (DOP) track, but also Serverless Compute (SVS), Partner Experience (PEX), Containers and more. Those sessions will be delivered by AWS specialists, partners and customers on different levels  and session types. To help you navigate your experience at re:invent for CDK-related sessions, we created a shortlist for you: 

# *Monday, November 28*

### DOP401: Get better at building AWS CDK constructs
`10:00 AM - 12:00 PM | Upper Level, Cristal 3, Wynn`
In this workshop, dive deep into how to design AWS CDK constructs, which are reusable and shareable cloud components that meet your organization's security, compliance, and governance requirements. Learn how to build, test, and share level-one constructs representing a single AWS resource, as well as higher-level abstractions (level-two and level-three constructs) that include built-in defaults and provision multiple AWS resources. You must bring your laptop to participate.
Session level: 400 - Expert | Session type: Workshop

### DOP314: Governance and security with infrastructure as code
2:30 PM - 3:30 PM | Level 3, Chairmans 355, MGM Grand
In this session, learn how to use AWS CloudFormation and the AWS CDK to deploy cloud applications in regulated environments while enforcing security controls. Find out how to catch issues early with cdk-nag, validate your pipelines with cfn-guard, and protect your accounts from unintended changes with CloudFormation hooks.
Session level: 300 – Advanced | Session type: Breakout Session

### DOP310: Continuous integration and delivery on AWS
4:00 PM - 6:00 PM | Level 1, Lafite 2, Wynn
In this workshop, learn about creating end-to-end CI/CD pipelines using infrastructure as code on AWS. Review fundamental concepts of continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery. Then, using TypeScript, create a web application and use Docker to build a container image. Using the same language your application is written in, build your CI/CD pipeline code and application infrastructure for both test and production environments using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). Get ready to build! You must bring your laptop to participate.
Session level: 300 – Advanced | Session type: Workshop

### SVS301: Refactoring to serverless
4:45 PM - 5:45 PM | Level 1, Forum 115, Caesars Forum
Serverless applications can draw from an entire system of fully managed services, such as message queuing, orchestration, and event routing. These services support fine-grained asynchronous applications and are also programmable with AWS CDK in the same language used to code your application logic. This session shows how you can refactor an existing serverless application to fully utilize AWS managed services and make service dependencies explicit, resulting in cleaner and more robust code. This session shares an initial catalog of refactoring and invites you to brainstorm new ones.
Session level: 300 – Advanced | Session type: Chalk Talk

### SVS207: Building serverless applications with AWS CDK
5:30 PM - 6:30 PM | Level 1, Alliance 312, Caesars Forum
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages. In this builders’ session, learn how to use AWS CDK constructs to manage, build, and deploy your application. You must bring your laptop to participate.
Session level: 200 – Intermediate | Session type: Builders' Session
