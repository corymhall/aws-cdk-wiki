This wiki includes a bunch of canned responses for GitHub issues. Feel free to edit.

### Bugs

Bugs are triaged for priority:

- **P0**: must be fixed right now through a patch release
- **P1**: major acknowledged bug in the area without a reasonable workaround
- **P2**: minor bug that has a workaround

### Features

Features are triaged as follows:

 - Determine if there is a duplicate or if it is related to some other feature/module/area, and close the issue.
 - Propose that the feature request will be submitted as an RFC to the [CDK RFC repo](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs), and transfer the issue to the RFC repo.
 - Estimate the size of the feature S/M/L and label it `effort/small`, `effort/medium`, `effort/large`. This estimation can serve the construct library planning work in the next quarter.

### Questions/Guidance

For *guidance* issues, in the most part either the owner can simply answer the question or kick off a discussion, or preferably refer the user to Stack Overflow to ask their question there. There is tons of value for these questions to be archived in SO over GitHub and in many cases the community will be able to answer.

```
Please post questions on Stack Overflow under
the [aws-cdk](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-cdk) tag.
